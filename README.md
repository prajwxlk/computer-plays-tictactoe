# Computer plays TicTacToe

This is an attempt towards making a Computer play TicTacToe. I plan to write code for playing the game using Rule-based logic, Q-Learning Algorithm and taking a mix of search + RL algorithms (the alphazero way). I am currently exploring RL right now and I intend to do it using projects, this one is the first attempt at it. 

You can read about my journey of implementing this project on [my blog](https://prajwxlk.notion.site/Computer-plays-TicTacToe-1999527560a780f5bf22f687cb9501b9)
